Hello, there !
&nbsp; This is Praguna Manvi. <br>
Welcome to my page.

I am working as a Senior SDE at a startup MAI Labs. I did my masters under Prof. Anoop Namboodiri and Prof. Kannan Srinathan in Computer Vision and Security. I specifically worked on security protocols and biometric template protection. I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science from BMSCE in 2020, Bangalore and M.S by Research from IIIT Hyderabad in 2023. 

I am keen on learning new things and working on problems where I can make an impact. For more details please find my [CV](https://praguna.github.io/cv/).

===
In a remote internship, contributed to Habana Pytorch's software stack for enabling eager mode Deep learning training and inference on Habana's accelerators. The role included rewriting custom torch-ops to the graph compiler's frontend, where a few core tensor operators were implemented and added to the custom torch plugin. Along with the torch-ops, a few composite kernels and visualization-debug tools for the compiled torch-graph were developed.


* Nov 2021- Nov 2023: Research Associate
  * CVIT (BASIL), IIIT Hyderabad
===
Developed and presented an R&D project as part of lab work to UIDAI, focusing on a
privacy-preserving authentication protocol. The project encompassed various aspects,
including the implementation of a secure verification protocol and optimization strategies.


* Feb 2020 - Nov 2021: Software Engineer
  * Dailyhunt
