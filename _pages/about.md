Hello there!<br>
I'm **Praguna Manvi**. <br>
Welcome to my page.

I am currently working as a Senior SDE at MAI labs, an enterprise blockchain startup. I pursued my master's degree under the guidance of Prof. Anoop Namboodiri and Prof. Kannan Srinathan in Computer Vision and Security. My research was focussed was on security protocols and biometric template protection. I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science from BMSCE, Bangalore in 2020, and obtained my M.S by Research from IIIT Hyderabad in 2023.


I am keen on learning new things and working on problems where I can make an impact. For more details please find my [CV](https://praguna.github.io/cv/).

===
Contributed to Intel Habana Pytorch's software stack for enabling eager mode Deep learning training and inference on Habana's accelerators. The role included rewriting custom torch-ops to the graph compiler's frontend, where a few core tensor operators were implemented and added to the custom torch plugin. Along with the torch-ops, a few composite kernels and visualization-debug tools for the compiled torch-graph were developed.


* Nov 2021- Nov 2023: Research Associate
  * CVIT (BASIL), IIIT Hyderabad
===
Developed and presented an R&D project as part of lab work to UIDAI, focusing on a
privacy-preserving authentication protocol. The project encompassed various aspects,
including the implementation of a secure verification protocol and optimization strategies.


* Feb 2020 - Nov 2021: Software Engineer
  * Dailyhunt
