Biometric signal consisting of irrelevant or non-distinctive features
can contain useful correlational properties that privacy-preserving
verification schemes can exploit. While an efficient protocol for iris
verification using noise has been presented in SIAN, it is not applicable
to other widely used modalities, i.e., face and fingerprint, since
the methods of noise extraction and comparison are different. In
this work, we design a verification protocol for secure dot product
computation and also propose noise extraction mechanisms for
face and fingerprint modalities. We evaluate the performance of
the protocol on CFP, LFW, CelebA, FVC 2004 DB1A, DB2A, DB3A, and SOCOFing datasets. While the protocol exhibits a slight degradation in accuracy, it provides information-theoretic security with a practical computational complexity.
